<p>Artificial intelligence generally falls under two main categories: (1)Narrow AI.      (2)Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).</p>
<p>Narrow AI: 
Sometimes referred to as "Weak AI," Narrow AI is often focused on performing a single task extremely well and while these machines may seem intelligent, they are operating under far more constraints and limitations than even the most basic human intelligence. Narrow AI is all around us and is easily the most successful realization of artificial intelligence to date.
Narrow AI has experienced many achievements in the last decade.
examples of Narrow AI include Google search, Image recognition software and Self-driving cars and planes.</p>
<p>Artificial General Intelligence:
The creation of a machine with human-level intelligence that can be applied to any task is the Holy Grail for many AI researchers, but the quest for AGI has been fraught with difficulty.
AGI has long been the muse of dystopian science fiction, in which super-intelligent robots overrun humanity, but experts agree it's not something we need to worry about anytime soon.
