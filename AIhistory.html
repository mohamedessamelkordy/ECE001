<p>AI HISTORY</p>
<p>artificial beings first appeared in the ancient Greek myths of Antiquity.
The following is a quick look at some of the most important events in AI.
1952: Arthur Samuel develops a self-learning program to play checkers.
1963: John McCarthy starts the AI Lab at Stanford.
1972: The logic programming language PROLOG is created.
1991: U.S. forces deploy DART, an automated logistics planning and scheduling tool, during the Gulf War.
1997: IBM's Deep Blue beats world chess champion Gary Kasparov
2005: STANLEY, a self-driving car, wins the DARPA Grand Challenge.

2008: Google makes breakthroughs in speech recognition and introduces the feature in its iPhone app.
2012: Andrew Ng, founder of the Google Brain Deep Learning project, feeds a neural network using deep learning algorithms 10 million YouTube videos as a training set. The neural network learned to recognize a cat without being told what a cat is, ushering in breakthrough era for neural networks and deep learning funding.
2014: Google makes first self-driving car to pass a state driving test.
